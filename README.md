The question that I picked was "Do you ever recline your seat when you fly?"
I picked this question because I found it fascinating and it followed the "opinion" criteria. 
I would assume most people recline their seat as a form of luxury and it's allowed. 
However, I was shocked to see the results were scattered amongst categories ranging from never to always. 
With 5 different categories, even though "once in a while" had the most responses, the other options were quite scattered.
